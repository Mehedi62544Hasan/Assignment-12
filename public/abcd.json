        "description": "Chinese smartphone giant OPPO has revealed a new handset under its F series lineup in the form of the F21 Pro 5G. There is also a non-5G model from the company of the same name, which I have reviewed earlier. Some key differences between the two devices lie in the chipset being used, screen refresh rate, cameras, and back panel design."

        "description": "There is no problem with the screen quality, which is still diamond-like pixels. The resolution is 1080P with a 120Hz refresh rate. And it uses a 1920Hz PWM dimming at low brightness and supports Dolby Vision, with peak brightness of 900 nits. Overall, the quality of this screen is superb in the same price range."
